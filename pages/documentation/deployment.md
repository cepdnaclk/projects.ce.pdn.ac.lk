## Deployment Instructions

This site is generated by using **Jekyll Builder** with theme, _just-the-docs_. Any commit into the project repository, _https://github.com/cepdnaclk/projects.ce.pdn.ac.lk_ will automatically build the web site.

### Local Installation

You can run following script to install necessary dependencies to run the Jekyll builder in your local machine.

```bash
gem install just-the-docs
gem install jekyll-sitemap
bundle exec just-the-docs rake search:init jekyll-sitemap
```

After that, you can run following script to run it in _watch_ mode.

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --increment
```

Alternatively, you can run it inside Docker while developing your site

```bash
docker-compose up
```
