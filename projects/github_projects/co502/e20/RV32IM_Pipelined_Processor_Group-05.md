description: 'The RV32IM pipeline processor project designs a 32-bit RISC-V processor
  with 5 stages: IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB. It supports RV32I base and M-extension (MUL/DIV),
  using forwarding, stalling, and branch prediction to manage hazards. Implemented
  in Verilog, it is simulated, tested with RISC-V tools, and optimized for performance.'
