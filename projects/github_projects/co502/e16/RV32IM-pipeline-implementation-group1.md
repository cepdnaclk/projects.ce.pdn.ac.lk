title: RV32IM pipeline implementation group1
permalink: /co502/e16/RV32IM-pipeline-implementation-group1/
description: The objective of this project was to design and implement a 5 stage pipeline
  CPU to support the RISC-V instruction architecture. This pipeline CPU supports the
  entire RV32IM ISA which contains 45 instructions. The designed pipeline CPU was
  implemented using behavioral modeling in verilogHDL and icarus Verilog was used
  compile and simulate. gtkWave was used to observe the behavior.
