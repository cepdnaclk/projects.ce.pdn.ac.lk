permalink: /co502/e19/RV32IM-Pipeline-Implementation-Group1/
description: This repository contains an implementation of a RISC-V RV32IM processor
  with a 5-stage pipeline architecture. The design includes instruction fetch, decode,
  execute, memory access, and write-back. It supports integer operations, multiplication,
  and memory access as defined in the RV32IM instruction set.
