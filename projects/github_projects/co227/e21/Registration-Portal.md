Efficient visitor management is essential for modern exhibitions and university events. Our team is developing an RFID-based registration system that enables fast check-ins, real-time tag linking, automated EXIT handling, and comprehensive admin analytics. The system design is complete, and we are seeking volunteer developers to help build the full prototype and complete integration.
