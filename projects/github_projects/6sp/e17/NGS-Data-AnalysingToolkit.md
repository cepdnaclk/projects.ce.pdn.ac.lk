title: NGS Data AnalysingToolkit
permalink: /6sp/e17/NGS-Data-AnalysingToolkit/
description: The development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has resulted
  in a rapid growth in the synthesis of large genomic datasets, but user-friendly
  tools for finding biomarkers of genes and visualizing this data have not kept pace.  Our
  project is to develop a web application which can provide a user-friendly interface
  for Alzheimer disease prediction and finding biomarker genes for particular disease
  using differential expression analysis of human mRNA sequence data. We improve on
  available tools by offering a range of normalization, feature selection and classification
  methods and a simple to use interface.
