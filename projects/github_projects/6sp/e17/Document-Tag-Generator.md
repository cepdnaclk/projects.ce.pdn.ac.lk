description: The project website of the Department of Computer Engineering currently
  has nearly 150 projects. These projects are categorized by only batches and subjectwise.
  Also, some of the projects have some tags but some of them are not relevant to those
  projects. Also, some projects do not have any tags. Currently, users can search
  projects by keywords, but those keywords are derived only from project descriptions.Our
  goal is to generate relevant tags for each project according to the description
  of the projects and other valid data available on the project pages.
