description: Road traffic injuries are a leading cause of death and disability. In
  low and middle income countries, vulnerable road users are commonly involved in
  crashes with severe injuries. Road traffic injuries are a major public health problem
  globally. About 1.2 million people are killed and more than 50 million are injured
  due to road traffic crashes annually.More than 90% of these deaths and injuries
  occur in low and middle income countries (LMIC) due to rapid motorization, lack
  of road safety culture, poor road conditions, and lack of education on road safety.
  Our aim is to reduce road accidents using machine learning techniques.
