title: Greenhouse monitoring and controlling based on IOT sensor data
permalink: /6sp/e17/Greenhouse-monitoring-and-controlling-based-on-IOT-sensor-data/
description: In traditional farming, farmer has to visit the farming land regularly
  to measure the various environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity and
  light intensity to cultivate the right crops at right time in right soil. Even though
  this traditional farming system have been used for years, the system is hectic and
  fail to prove high productivity rate as farmer usually unable to measure all the
  parameter accurately. In contrast, greenhouse farming is a system where farmer cultivate
  crops in ecosystem environments where all environmental parameters are adjusted
  based on crop types. Automation in greenhouse is a method where farmer can monitor
  and control the greenhouse environment automatically from anywhere in the world
  any time. Automated greenhouse monitoring and controlling system that incorporate
  various sensors such as temperature sensor, humidity sensor and light sensor to
  collect possible environmental parameters of greenhouse. Internet of Things (IoT)
  is used to store data to a database and process the collected data and finally send
  the information to the web interface which has been developed for monitoring and
  controlling of greenhouse by the user.
