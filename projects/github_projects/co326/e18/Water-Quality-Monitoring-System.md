title: Water Quality Monitoring System
permalink: /co326/e18/Water-Quality-Monitoring-System/
description: A water quality monitoring system using an ESP8266 microcontroller, which
  will continuously monitor the temperature and TDS level of the water. The system
  will then process this data and compare it with predetermined acceptable limits.
  After comparing the values, our system will indicate whether the quality of water
  is good or bad using LEDs.
