Losing valuables like keys, wallets, or laptops is stressful on a busy campus. The Lost and Found Information System is a smart, privacy-first platform that connects people who’ve lost items with those who’ve found them using structured reports, intelligent matching, and secure gradual disclosure to prevent fraud and protect privacy.
