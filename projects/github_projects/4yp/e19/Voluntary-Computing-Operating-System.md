title: Voluntary Computing Operating System
permalink: /4yp/e19/Voluntary-Computing-Operating-System/
description: A lightweight operating system design for voluntary computing across
  peer-to-peer (P2P) devices connected via local network, enabling efficient resource
  pooling and sharing, fault tolerance, and scalability. The proposed DOS will allow
  devices within a local network to share excess computational resources dynamically.
