  Devices
permalink: /4yp/e19/LowComplexity-Algorithms-For-EnergyEfficient-Arrhythmia-Classification-In-Wearable-Devices/
description: In this project, we aim to develop a low-complex arrhythmia classification
  algorithm that consumes a minimum amount of power and memory and can be implemented
  in a resource-constrained environment like wearable devices.
