title: Machine Learning Based Automated PAR Index Calculation for Orthodontic Treatment
permalink: /4yp/e19/Machine-Learning-Based-Automated-PAR-Index-Calculation-for-Orthodontic-Treatment/
description: This research is about developing an automated software tool that calculates
  the Peer Assessment Rating (PAR) Index to evaluate orthodontic treatment success.
  This project leverages 3D orthodontic study models (.stl files) and machine learning
  algorithms to create a cost-effective, accurate, and accessible evaluation system.
