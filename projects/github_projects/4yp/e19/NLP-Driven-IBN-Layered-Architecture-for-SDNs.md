title: NLP Driven IBN Layered Architecture for SDNs
permalink: /4yp/e19/NLP-Driven-IBN-Layered-Architecture-for-SDNs/
description: 'This research designs a scalable, NLP-driven intent-based networking
  architecture for SDNs. It features a three-layered structure: Translation (NLP-based),
  Policy Optimization (ML/RL-based), and Intent Enforcement (SDN-integrated). The
  goal is to enhance network management efficiency and adaptability.'
