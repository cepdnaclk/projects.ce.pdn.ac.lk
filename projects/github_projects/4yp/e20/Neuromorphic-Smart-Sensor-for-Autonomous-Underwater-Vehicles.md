title: Neuromorphic Smart Sensor for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles
permalink: /4yp/e20/Neuromorphic-Smart-Sensor-for-Autonomous-Underwater-Vehicles/
description: This paper proposes an integrated system that combines neuromorphic smart
  sensors, spiking neural networks (SNNs) on embedded GPU platforms (NVIDIA Jetson),
  and CORS/RTK-based surface buoy positioning to address important challenges in autonomous
  underwater vehicle (AUV) operations.
