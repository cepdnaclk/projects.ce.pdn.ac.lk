title: XAI Driven Threat Intelligence for WiFi 7 6G Using FL and Blockchain Based
  Trust Sharing
permalink: /4yp/e20/XAI-Driven-Threat-Intelligence-for-WiFi-7-6G-Using-FL-and-Blockchain-Based-Trust-Sharing/
description: An advanced cybersecurity framework where explainable AI (XAI) models
  are trained via federated learning across distributed nodes to detect threats in
  Wi-Fi 7 and 6G networks. Blockchain ensures secure, transparent sharing of threat
  intelligence and model updates, enhancing trust and integrity.
