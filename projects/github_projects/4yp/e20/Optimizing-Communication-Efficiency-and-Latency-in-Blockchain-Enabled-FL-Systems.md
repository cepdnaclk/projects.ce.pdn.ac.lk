title: Optimizing Communication Efficiency and Latency in Blockchain Enabled FL Systems
permalink: /4yp/e20/Optimizing-Communication-Efficiency-and-Latency-in-Blockchain-Enabled-FL-Systems/
description: An advanced cybersecurity framework where explainable AI (XAI) models
  are trained via federated learning across distributed nodes to detect threats in
  Wi-Fi 7 and 6G networks. Blockchain ensures secure, transparent sharing of threat
  intelligence and model updates, enhancing trust and integrity.
