title: "AI Enabled Digital Twin for Crack Evolution in Concrete Beams "
permalink: /4yp/e20/AI-Enabled-Digital-Twin-for-Crack-Evolution-in-Concrete-Beams-/
description: This research presents a Digital Twin framework overcoming SHM limitations.
  We developed a surrogate deep learning model trained on FEA simulations with Concrete
  Damaged Plasticity parameters. It captures complex behaviors like cracking and yielding,
  revealing internal degradation missed by sensors.
