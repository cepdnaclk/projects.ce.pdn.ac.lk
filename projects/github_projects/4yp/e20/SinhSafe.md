description: SinhSafe benchmarks XLM-R, SinBERT, and SinhLlama to identify the best
  model for Sinhala/Singlish cyberbullying detection. Our core contribution is a large
  pseudo-labeled dataset with fine-grained labels (Normal, Offensive, Bullying), processed
  via a hybrid transliteration pipeline to advance low-resource NLP safety tools.
