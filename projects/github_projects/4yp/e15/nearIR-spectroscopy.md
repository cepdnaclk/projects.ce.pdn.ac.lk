description: Near-Infrared spectroscopy is used for better vein visualization to make
  the venipuncture process more efficient. It is usually a painful and time-consuming
  process and its difficulty increases with the dark skin tones, obesity of patients,
  and several other health and physical conditions.  Although near-IR spectroscopy
  is identified as a good solution, its usage is limited to availability, high cost,
  and doubts about accuracy. The cost of each of these products is very high and not
  affordable especially in countries like ours. We have implemented a mechanism for
  better accuracy and lower risk, using an illumination system that favors Asian skin
  types, while reducing the cost of the device so that it is more affordable especially
  for common clinical use in countries like ours.
