title: Real Time Emotion Recognition using Electrocardiogram Analysis
permalink: /4yp/e15/Real-Time-Emotion-Recognition-using-Electrocardiogram-Analysis/
description: Emotion recognition is a powerful and very useful technique in the modern
  world in almost every field including healthcare, entertainment, automotive industry
  etc. The main objective of this project is to implement a real time model, which
  can recognise an extended range of emotions with a higher accuracy using ECG signals
  to recognize sudden and complex emotional changes of humans. While identifying human
  emotions, identifying emotions of animal subjects is equally important since it
  will help to understand their perspectives, needs and problems related to their
  physical and mental well-being while safeguarding their welfare. Therefore, a preliminary
  analysis to identify similarities and differences between human and animal emotion
  recognition is done.
