description: Online examinations require human invigilation either by live monitoring
  or inspection of recorded video to ensure academic integrity. This process is not
  feasible always since exams can be taken at any time and it involves high cost.  This
  project proposes an Online Proctoring System to automate invigilation processes
  by making use of inputs from a web browser, without using any external hardware
  or standalone application. As a result, several misconducts during the examination
  can be identified and labelled as suspicious.
