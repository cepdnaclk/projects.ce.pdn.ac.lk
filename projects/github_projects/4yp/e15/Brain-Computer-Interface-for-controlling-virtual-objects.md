permalink: /4yp/e15/Brain-Computer-Interface-for-controlling-virtual-objects/
description: Develop a Brain-Computer Interface for Controlling virtual objects using
  the self-paced mind intent of a person. Here we have developed a Real-time pipeline
  for recognizing thought patterns using machine learning techniques and feed into
  a virtual environment(unity engine) for controlling virtual objects.
