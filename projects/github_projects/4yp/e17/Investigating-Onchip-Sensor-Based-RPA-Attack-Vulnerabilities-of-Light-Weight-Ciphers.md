title: Investigating Onchip Sensor Based RPA Attack Vulnerabilities of Light Weight
  Ciphers
permalink: /4yp/e17/Investigating-Onchip-Sensor-Based-RPA-Attack-Vulnerabilities-of-Light-Weight-Ciphers/
description: At the moment there are some proven Correlation Power Analysis attacks
  against AES cipher with help of on-chip sensors and machine learning techniques.
  The aim of this research project is to investigate other ciphers for Remote Power
  Analysis Attacks and propose countermeasures to prevent RPA attacks on those ciphers.
