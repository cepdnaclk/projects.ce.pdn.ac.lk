title: 3D Occupancy Prediction for Autonomous Driving
permalink: /4yp/e17/3D-Occupancy-Prediction-for-Autonomous-Driving/
description: 3D scene understanding and reasoning is crucial for a vision-based autonomous
  driving model. In this work, we mainly focus on building an End-to-End autonomous
  driving architecture with 3D occupancy prediction that'll help downstream vision
  and driving tasks.
