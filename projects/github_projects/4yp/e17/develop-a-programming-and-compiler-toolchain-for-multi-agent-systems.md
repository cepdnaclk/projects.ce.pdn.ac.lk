title: develop a programming and compiler toolchain for multi agent systems
permalink: /4yp/e17/develop-a-programming-and-compiler-toolchain-for-multi-agent-systems/
description: "The aim is to design an Integrated Development Environment to build software for multi-agent systems. The IDE shall provide facilities to compose algorithms at a high-level (ideally in a visual manner), and compile them over multiple stages into binaries and program the hardware over-the-air (OTA)."
