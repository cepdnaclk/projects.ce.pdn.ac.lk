title: swarm intelligence programming framework
permalink: /4yp/e16/swarm-intelligence-programming-framework/
description: This particular project will focus on building a high-level programming
  and compiler framework which can be used to 'write' or 'draw' algorithms and convert
  them into low-level code. The framework will support multiple different types of
  robot hardware (both real and virtual).
