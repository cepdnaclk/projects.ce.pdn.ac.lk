title: Using Computer Vision and Agent Based Modelling to Explore the Human Elephant
  Conflict
permalink: /4yp/e16/Using-Computer-Vision-and-Agent-Based-Modelling-to-Explore-the-Human-Elephant-Conflict/
description: The initial stage of this work focuses on creating a segmented image
  from a given satellite image with different classes. In the second stage, these
  images should be converted to an ABM-friendly format. At the final stage, they can
  be used to simulate the real-world environment with related agents using a suitable
  Agent-based model.
