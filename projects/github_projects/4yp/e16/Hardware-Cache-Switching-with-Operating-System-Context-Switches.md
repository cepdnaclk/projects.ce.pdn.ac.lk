title: Hardware Cache Switching with Operating System Context Switches
permalink: /4yp/e16/Hardware-Cache-Switching-with-Operating-System-Context-Switches/
description: An operating system performs a context switch when it suspends one kernel-level
  thread and activates a different thread. Typically, data stored in the cache memory
  are lost in such events. This project aims to explore the advantages of maintaining
  multiple small 'cache-storage-cores' and switching to the appropriate one during
  a context switch. We will use a RISC-V CPU with a suitable embedded operating system
  and a custom-built cache for the FPGA-based experiments
