title: Acceleration of DTW algorithm for real time nanopore selective sequencing using
  GPUs
permalink: /4yp/e16/Acceleration-of-DTW-algorithm-for-real-time-nanopore-selective-sequencing-using-GPUs/
description: The project aims to optimize the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm
  and accelerate it using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), So that algorithm can
  be executed in a GPU-equipped laptop or a GPU-equipped embedded device like NVIDIA
  Jetson, rather than connecting to a massive server.
