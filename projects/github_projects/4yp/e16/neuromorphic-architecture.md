title: neuromorphic architecture
permalink: /4yp/e16/neuromorphic-architecture/
description: Neuromorphic architectures are hardware architectures that use the biologically
  inspired neural functions as the basis of operation. Information processing based
  on spiking neuron architectures have caught considerable attention in recent years
  due to its low power consumption compared to traditional artificial neural networks.  In
  this project, as the first stage, we are implementing parallel multiple processing
  elements based on RISC-V architecture to represent biological neurons. Single neurons
  can be implemented as a single processor with local memory access or since the spike
  time of biological neurons is in the millisecond order multiple neurons can be virtualized
  to a single processor. At the second stage of the process, we are expecting to design
  encoders and decoders to benchmark the architecture by solving classical machine
  learning problems.
