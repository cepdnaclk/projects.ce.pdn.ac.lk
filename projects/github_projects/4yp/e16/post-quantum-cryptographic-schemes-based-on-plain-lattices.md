title: post quantum cryptographic schemes based on plain lattices
permalink: /4yp/e16/post-quantum-cryptographic-schemes-based-on-plain-lattices/
description: This project proposes the use of plain lattices with learning with errors
  problem to implement a cryptographic scheme which can run on classical computers
  and provides security against quantum based attacks. We are proposing key sizes
  for efficient operations and implement a lattice trapdoor function. Also we will
  improve current random oracle based model in to a standard model.
