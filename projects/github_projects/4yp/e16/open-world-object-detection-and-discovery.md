description: 'Object detection is a well-known computer vision technique for locating
  instances of objects in images. Open World Object Detection refers to tackling object
  detection tasks in an open-world setting where the task is to detect a known set
  of object categories while simultaneously identifying unknown objects. Moreover,
  it is required to identify instances of unknown objects and subsequently learn to
  recognize them when training data progressively arrive. An oracle (eg: - a human
  annotator) is needed to introduce new class labels for the identified unknowns to
  classify those to relevant object classes in the next increments of learning steps.'
