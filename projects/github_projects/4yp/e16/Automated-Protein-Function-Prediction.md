title: Automated Protein Function Prediction
permalink: /4yp/e16/Automated-Protein-Function-Prediction/
description: Automated protein function prediction is critical for the annotation
  of uncharacterized protein sequences, where accurate prediction methods are still
  required.we expect to create an accurate prediction model that assigns the best
  sub-graph of the gene ontology to each new protein and output a prediction score
  for this sub-graph and/or each predicted term .
