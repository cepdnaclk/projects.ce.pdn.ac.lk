title: Machine Learning based Atmospheric Duct Interference cancellation in TD LTE
  networks
permalink: /4yp/e16/Machine-Learning-based-Atmospheric-Duct-Interference-cancellation-in-TD-LTE-networks/
description: The aim of the project is to find a method to overcome the problem which
  is caused by the atmospheric duct to 4G LTE networks. In order to do that we are
  aiming to build two ML-based models which can predict the duct interference and
  the other one to minimize such interference.
