description: Programmable indoor drone swarm testbed using low-cost ESP32 mini drones
  for real-world networking and collision-avoidance research. Drones use UWB for localization,
  ESP-NOW for peer communication, and decentralized control. A hub handles configuration,
  safety, and logging for controlled swarm experiments.
