title: Smart Laser Distance Meter
permalink: /3yp/e21/Smart-Laser-Distance-Meter/
description: A smart laser distance meter that combines LiDAR and IMU sensing to provide
  high-accuracy measurements, automatic area and volume calculations, and real-time
  2D floor plan generation. The system uses an ESP32 and a mobile app for visualization,
  storage, and export.
