description: Dia-Smart is an IoT ecosystem automating diabetes compliance. It combines
  a Smart Cap for precise insulin dosage tracking via inertial sensing, a Gluco-Fetcher
  to digitize blood sugar readings, and a Smart Vault for inventory safety. This closed-loop
  system correlates therapy data to prevent dangerous errors for elderly and Type
  1 patients.
