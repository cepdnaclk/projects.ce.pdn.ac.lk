permalink: /3yp/e14/Telepresence-Robot/
description: A telepresence robot is a mobile, remote-controlled device that enables
  a person to be virtually present and to interact in a remote place. This project
  will be based upon developing such a robot for the department. With the use of interactive
  elements such as high definition audio and video, the robot will allow users (students/staff)
  to collaborate in person and remotely.
