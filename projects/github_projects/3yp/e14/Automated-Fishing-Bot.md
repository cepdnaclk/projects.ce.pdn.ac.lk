title: Automated Fishing Bot
permalink: /3yp/e14/Automated-Fishing-Bot
description: " Fishery Industry has not always been friendly to fishermen. Identifying high density fishing areas, reaching there and spending hours to find and capture fish is just too much for a human being. Therefore, we are going to introduce a fishing bot. This bot will be able to handle above said difficulties and will help fishermen to expand fishing areas and monitor fishing information gathered which will eventually help the industry. "
