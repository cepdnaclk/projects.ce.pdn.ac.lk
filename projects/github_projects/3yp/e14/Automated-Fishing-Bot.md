title: Automated Fishing Bot
permalink: /3yp/e14/Automated-Fishing-Bot/
description: Fishery Industry has not always been friendly to fishermen. Identifying
  high density fishing areas, reaching there and spending hours to find and capture
  fish is just too much for a human being. Therefore, we are going to introduce a
  fishing bot. This bot will be able to handle above said difficulties and will help
  fishermen to expand fishing areas and monitor fishing information gathered which
  will eventually help the industry.
