title: Automated Greenhouse Fertilizing System
permalink: /3yp/e14/Automated-Greenhouse-Fertilizing-System/
description: This project aims to calculate the component(N , K , P) levels which
  are responsible for the growth of the plant in a real time basis and maintain the
  component level which is required for the relevant plant. Using this system we can
  increase the lifetime of a plant and can get the maximum harvest out of the plant.
