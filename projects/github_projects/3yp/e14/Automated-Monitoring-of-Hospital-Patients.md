permalink: /3yp/e14/Automated-Monitoring-of-Hospital-Patients/
description: This study develops a remote monitoring diagnostic framework to detect
  condition of patients in real-time which helps avoiding potential diseases.This
  system will be basically used in hospitals and medical centers. The proposed system
  has an embedded micro controller connected to a set of medical sensors (the sensors
  would differ according to the condition of the patient) and a wireless communication
  module (Bluetooth) .
