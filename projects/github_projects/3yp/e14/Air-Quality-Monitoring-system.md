title: Air Quality Monitoring system
permalink: /3yp/e14/Air-Quality-Monitoring-system
description: "Monitoring and maintaining air quality and sound quality are most important aspects of city management. A significant proportion of the population lives in cities, where air quality index has exceeded limits for several air pollutants like - particulate matter (PM), ozone, nitrogen dioxide.The Noise pollution can cause hypertension, high stress levels, tinnitus, hearing loss, sleep disturbances, and other harmful effects.These pollution pose serious health and environment risks. Therefore air and sound quality monitoring system is an important component of any smart city.  So in this unified project we develop a system to monitor , forecast and reducing air pollution in a city through actionable data. the data will be received from gas sensors and the sound sensor. we are trying measure the data using this module in urban areas.  All those data taken from those sensors, are sent to a central server and processed there.if the permit levels are exceed Regulatory agencies or pollution control boards will be informed.and also person can see whether the city is suitable for living and what will be the future. they can get the information about Pollution Awareness."
