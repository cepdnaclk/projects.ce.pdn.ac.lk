title: Air Quality Monitoring system
permalink: /3yp/e14/Air-Quality-Monitoring-system/
description: Monitoring and maintaining air quality and sound quality are most important
  aspects of city management. A significant proportion of the population lives in
  cities, where air quality index has exceeded limits for several air pollutants like
  - particulate matter (PM), ozone, nitrogen dioxide.The Noise pollution can cause
  hypertension, high stress levels, tinnitus, hearing loss, sleep disturbances, and
  other harmful effects.These pollution pose serious health and environment risks.
  Therefore air and sound quality monitoring system is an important component of any
  smart city.  So in this unified project we develop a system to monitor , forecast
  and reducing air pollution in a city through actionable data. the data will be received
  from gas sensors and the sound sensor. we are trying measure the data using this
  module in urban areas.  All those data taken from those sensors, are sent to a central
  server and processed there.if the permit levels are exceed Regulatory agencies or
  pollution control boards will be informed.and also person can see whether the city
  is suitable for living and what will be the future. they can get the information
  about Pollution Awareness.
