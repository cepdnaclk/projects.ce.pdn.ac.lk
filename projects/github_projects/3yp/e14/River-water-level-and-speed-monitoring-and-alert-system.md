permalink: /3yp/e14/River-water-level-and-speed-monitoring-and-alert-system
description: "This is a system that will monitor the water levels of a river/lake/stream and predicts the occurrence of a flood and generate an alert accordingly. This system would not only measure the water level but also the water velocity in order to give a better prediction of the risky situations."
