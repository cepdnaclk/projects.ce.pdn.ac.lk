title: Smart Warehouse Monitoring for Paddy Storage
permalink: /3yp/e14/Smart-Warehouse-Monitoring-for-Paddy-Storage
description: "Networked embedded systems have become  quite important nowadays, especially for monitoring and control of distance and dislocated objects. This concept is applied in many fields in today as it increases the accuracy rather than controlling manually.  Therefore we thought to implement a embedded system to monitor and control physical quantities of a rice paddy storage. Controlling such conditions precisely will ensure the best quality. This will helpful to the businessmen who having number of such stores in many locations as it is hard to control them manually. So by using this system they can operate it easily and being in any location.  This system can be used in storage by changing the desired physical quantities."
