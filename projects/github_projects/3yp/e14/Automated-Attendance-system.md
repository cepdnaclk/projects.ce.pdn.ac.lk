  System using biometric technology. This replaces the traditional attendance marking
  methods to a fool Proof method.This will reduce the time spent in a lecture for
  attendance marking and increases the accuracy of the process.This will be a hand
  held device which is passed in the class while the lecture is going on. The students
  can simply place the finger over the sensor to mark the presence in their class.
