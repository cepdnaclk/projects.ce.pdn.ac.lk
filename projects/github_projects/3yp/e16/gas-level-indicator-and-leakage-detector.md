title: gas level indicator and leakage detector
permalink: /3yp/e16/gas-level-indicator-and-leakage-detector
description: "LP gas tank users face various difficulties because of not having a precise way to find the remaining gas amount in the tank. To overcome those problems with some protection, we are introducing the gas level indicator and leakage detector. Gas Level Indicator and Leakage Detector is a system aimed at LP gas tank users and distributors, consisting of two main areas; a gas level indicator and a gas leakage detector. To indicate gas level, the device display and the mobile/web application will be updated in real-time, displaying the current existing gas percentage in the tank. For gas leakage detection, a buzzer will alarm the user about it while sending a notification to the mobile/web application."
