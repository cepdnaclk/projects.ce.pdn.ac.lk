title: gas level indicator and leakage detector
permalink: /3yp/e16/gas-level-indicator-and-leakage-detector/
description: LP gas tank users face various difficulties because of not having a precise
  way to find the remaining gas amount in the tank. To overcome those problems with
  some protection, we are introducing the gas level indicator and leakage detector.
  Gas Level Indicator and Leakage Detector is a system aimed at LP gas tank users
  and distributors, consisting of two main areas; a gas level indicator and a gas
  leakage detector. To indicate gas level, the device display and the mobile/web application
  will be updated in real-time, displaying the current existing gas percentage in
  the tank. For gas leakage detection, a buzzer will alarm the user about it while
  sending a notification to the mobile/web application.
