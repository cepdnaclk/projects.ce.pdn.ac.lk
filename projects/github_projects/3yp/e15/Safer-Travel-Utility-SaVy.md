description: "Sri Lanka has the second highest road density in Asia in 2011 (173.8 km/km2). Although there are so many roads and buses in the road still people don’t like to use public transportation very much. we feel, it’s because public transportation is very unpredictable and sometimes, we have to wait hours and hours in bus stations waiting for a bus. It’s so hard to find the right bus for the right location if you don’t know the right route number. So, we feel this all happens due to the inefficiency and mismanagement of resources. So, our plan is to make a tracker management system for bus owners."
