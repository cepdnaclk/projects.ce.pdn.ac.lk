Usually people are not happy with standing in a queue or waiting a long time in the hospital to see the doctor as well as doctors also need a most efficient and effective way to examine their patients. Mostly in routine medical checkups doctor needs a data of several biometric parameters of patient’s body. These data can be measured by some sensors and stored through our system."
