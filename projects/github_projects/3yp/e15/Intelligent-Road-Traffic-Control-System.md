title: Intelligent Road Traffic Control System
permalink: /3yp/e15/Intelligent-Road-Traffic-Control-System/
description: "Vehicle travel across the world is increasing, especially in larger urban areas. It is a serious problem in traffic congestions in many major cities around the world and in these cities, it has become a nightmare for travelers. Intelligent control of traffic in the future will become a very important issue. Therefore, to better accommodation of this increasing demand, traffic control algorithms need to be simulated and optimized. "
