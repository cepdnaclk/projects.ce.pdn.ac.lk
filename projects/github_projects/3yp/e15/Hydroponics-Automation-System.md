description: "Hydroponics is the method of growing plants in a nutrient-rich water-based environment which uses artificial lighting. This method is widely used in modern agriculture because of less space and conservation of water. But the main disadvantage of this system is the need of constant monitoring to get the maximum benefits from it."
