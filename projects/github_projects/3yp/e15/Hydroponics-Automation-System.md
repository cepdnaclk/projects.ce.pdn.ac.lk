title: Hydroponics Automation System
permalink: /3yp/e15/Hydroponics-Automation-System/
description: Hydroponics is the method of growing plants in a nutrient-rich water-based
  environment which uses artificial lighting. This method is widely used in modern
  agriculture because of less space and conservation of water. But the main disadvantage
  of this system is the need of constant monitoring to get the maximum benefits from
  it.
