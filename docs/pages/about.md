            The Department of Computer Engineering is the youngest department of the Faculty of Engineering,
            University of Peradeniya. Read more about department history → <a

            Every student of the faculty has been required to conduct a final year thesis project from the inception
            of
            the faculty. Computer Engineering was no different. Every student has completed a thesis project with
            (individually or as a group) in the final two semesters of the undergraduate.

            However, computer engineering was one of the first departments to introduce projects to the majority of
            the
            academic courses in every year. This approach to sharpen the technical skills through practical projects
            has
            proven to be very successful through the years. As of 2020, many departments of the faculty have adopted
            this technique.

            Recently, in XXX the department has started experimenting with unified projects. The objective of this
            approach is to let students build up connections between the knowledge and skills gained in different
            courses. A massive success has been achieved through this techniques. As of 2020, the department is
            trying
            to have at least XX such unified projects through the undergraduate (this is in addition to the thesis
            project and course projects).
        </p>
        <p>
            Several attempts have been undertaken to preserve the records and codebases of the projects being
            conducted
            in the department [link1 , link2, link3]. This website is the successor of those attempts. We hope to
            maintain a sustainable repository for such information here.
